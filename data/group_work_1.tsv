Use case	Data type	Organism group	Scientific application area	Purpose of data production	Public repository for your data	Would you feel comfortable exposing part of the metadata at sample level or only aggregated information for the whole dataset prior to publication?	Sample level: Metadata you would allow for early discovery (pre-publication)	Do you have a local or national system (e.g. a data hub) that enable capturing rich metadata that can be reused later?	Aggregated level: Information you would share for early discovery (pre-publication)	ENA checklist	MIxS checklist	Other checklists	Do you have access to contextual data from the wet lab (e.g. protocols for data generation [info like SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC Network Protocol])	What kind of attribution would you like to see if your data is re-used?	Metadata needed for your analysis beyond standard checklist elements	Additional metadata from the wet lab (e.g. the "ENA Read Submission")	Additional metadata from the data analysis (e.g. assembly & annotation)	Metadata from standard checklists you would like to be mandatory
